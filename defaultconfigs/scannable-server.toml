[general]
	#The basic scan radius without range modules. Higher values mean more computational
	#overhead and thus potentially worse performance while scanning.
	#IMPORTANT: some modules such as the block and ore scanner modules will already use
	#a reduced radius based on this value. Specifically, the ore scanners multiply this
	#value by 0.25, and the block scanner multiplies it by 0.5.
	#Range modules will boost the range by half this value.
