## Installing

1) Download the zipfile.
2) Extract it to an empty folder.
3) If you want to change RAM usage, Java arguments etc, see the "settings" file.
4) Double click "server-start.bat" (Windows) or "server-start.sh" (Unix), whichever is appropriate.
5) Set EULA=true in the generated eula file. Make sure there are no spaces in the EULA file.
6) Enjoy!


## Updating

1) Backup your world, including config, defaultconfigs, kubejs, mods and patchouli_books folders.
2) Delete the config, defaultconfigs, kubejs, mods and patchouli_books folders from the server.
3) Download server files, note the Forge version at the top of the changelog.
4) Extract into an empty folder.
5) Move the config, defaultconfigs, kubejs, mods and patchouli_books folders from the extracted zip into the server folder.
6) Make sure the Forge version set in settings.cfg is the same as the one stated in the changelog. 
	The settings.cfg file from the server files will always have the correct version.
7) Reapply all changes you have made to the server. I recommend that you keep all changes in a seperate
	folder, so you can just move them over after updating.
