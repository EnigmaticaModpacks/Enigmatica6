[data]
	#Defines how the experience should be handled when the player dies.
	#DROP: Drops the xp as normal.
	#REMOVE: Doesn't drop or restore the xp. Effectively removes it on death.
	#KEEP_VANILLA: Stores the same amount of xp that would've been dropped normally into the grave.
	#KEEP_ALL: Stores all the players xp in the graves to restore it.
	#Allowed Values: DROP, REMOVE, KEEP_VANILLA, KEEP_ALL
	experienceHandling = "KEEP_VANILLA"
	#Defines the amount of entries per player that can be stored to retrieve using commands.
	#Once the entry count overflows, the oldest entries will be removed.
	#Range: 1 ~ 99
	graveEntryCount = 10

#Grave Spawn Place Handling
#The grave will first scan down from the death position until it finds a solid block to place the grave on.
#If there is no solid block below the death position, it will attempt to scan from the 'scanHeight' value
#It will scan up to +-'scanRange' in attempt to find a solid block with 2 air blocks above it to spawn the grave on.
#If it fails to find a place, it will then either: 
#   - Place a block at y=1 with the grave on top, if the 'scanHeight' were filled with block
#   - Place a block at y='scanHeight' with the grave on top, if the 'scanHeight' were filled with air
[position]

	#Range: 0 ~ 255
	scanHeight = 60
	#The vertical range (up/down) from the initial position to scan for a valid spot to place a grave
	#Range: 0 ~ 255
	scanRange = 10
	#The block that should spawn below the grave if there is none
