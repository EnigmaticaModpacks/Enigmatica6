The upgrades come in 3 versions - 1x1, 2x2, and 3x3, which will scan inventory slots in groups of 1, 4, and 9 respectively. So for a vanilla chest, these upgrades will look for 27, 6, and 3 recipes respectively. The upgrade will not consume the last item in each slot of a recipe, allowing it to remember the recipe.",
				"",
				"Crafting Placeholders are optional, but can be used to fill empty slots. The crafting upgrade will see these and ignore the slots, making it easier for you to read the recipe. The Fluid Crafter upgrades can also make use of Fluid Crafting Placeholders - these represent a bucket of fluid that the recipe requires, and they will use fluid stored in the upgrade (transferred from the fluid network) instead of a bucket.",
				"",
				"The Compacting upgrades will look for at least 4 or 9 items in a single slot (2x2 and 3x3 respectively) that can be compacted, and display the resulting item. They will only operate if the display is empty, so you need to make sure to transfer products out of the display.",
				"",
				"Pro Tips: You can use any inventory below the pedestal, even droppers and dispensers. Using these gives you a 3x3 inventory, making it easy to lay out a crafting table recipe. Additionally, these crafting upgrades function by continually scanning the inventory for applicable recipes, so the fewer inventory slots they needs to scan the faster they will operate."
