				"The Extruder module Mk1 will, on high redstone signal, place a line of blocks in front of itself from the router's inventory, and retract them again when the redstone signal is disabled. The stats of the breaker module used to craft the extruder will be inherited."
				""
				"The Mk2 variant works a little differently; it will follow a pattern of blocks set in the module's configuration screen, and when extruding, it places fake versions of the blocks which drop nothing when broken. So this can be used to make fancier pattered doors, and doesn't need to worry about harvest levels or item management."
