Requirements:
	● A Schematicannon from the Create mod
	● One Schematic Table from the Create mod
	● Gunpowder to power the cannon
	● An Empty Schematic

Loading a schematic is easy:
	1) The schematics themselves are sorted into folders by mod, but any schematics in the root Schematic folder (where this readme lives) will be available from the Schematic Table. Move/Copy them from the mod folder to the root Schematic folder.
	2) In game, open the Schematic Table. Select the schematic you want to load, put the Empty Schematic into the table, and click the checkmark.
	3) Use the schematic to place a ghost of the structure in-world. While holding the schematic, there will be onscreen instructions for adjusting the ghost.
	4) Load the Schematicannon with the schematic and gunpowder. Place inventories with the required blocks in them next to the cannon.
	5) Click the start button twice, and watch it build your structure.

Some schematics will require some manual effort once pasted. For example, the Cannon is not capable of placing the Turbine Blades for Mekanism's Industrial Turbine. These must be installed by hand. It also cannot place liquids, so you will need to fill Astral structures by hand.

The Create wiki has some very good pages on the process of loading and constructing Schematics:
