2.13.0-199 (24 Jun 2021)

New

* Added back CraftTweaker support!
* - Docs will be added to [https://docs.blamejared.com/](https://docs.blamejared.com/) but in the short term can be browsed at [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/CraftTweaker-Documentation/tree/pncr-docs-1.16/docs/mods/PneumaticCraft-Repressurized](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/CraftTweaker-Documentation/tree/pncr-docs-1.16/docs/mods/PneumaticCraft-Repressurized)

Updates

* Air Grate Module is now able to absorb XP orbs
* - If there's an adjacent fluid tank, orbs will be converted to Memory Essence and stored in the tank (20mB fluid per XP point)
* Updated ru_ru translations
* Added config setting pneumaticcraft-common.toml -> Heat -> addDefaultFluidEntries which controls whether heat properties for modded fluids will be automatically added
* - Note that vanilla water and lava are still always auto-added; this setting is just for modded fluids
* - If set to no, the intention is that heat properties for modded fluids should be added by the modpack maker as required (see [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/wiki/Block-Heat-Properties](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/wiki/Block-Heat-Properties))
* Elevator now has a getVelocity() Lua method for ComputerCraft purpose
* - Returns current velocity in blocks/tick; negative values indicate elevator is descending
* Blocks found by the Pneumatic Helmet Block Tracker misc mode can now be controlled by block tag
* - Use the pneumaticcraft:block_tracker_misc_blocks tag
* - Defaults are the same as before: TNT, Tripwires, Bee Nests and all silverfish-infested stone blocks
* - Important: resist the temptation to add very common blocks to this (e.g. #forge:ores) since excessive results can cause severe client-side FPS drops
* Crop Supports now pass player right-clicks along to the enclosed block more intelligently
* - Makes planting and bone-mealing crops in a Crop Support far easier
* Right-clicking an Aphorism Tile which is invisible now passes the right-click to the block behind
* - This makes invisible Aphorism Tiles useful for labelling chests etc. with text or displayed items; the chest behind can now easily be opened with a right-click
* - Sneak+right-click an invisible Aphorism Tile with an empty hand to open the editor GUI
* All minecart types are now tracked with the Pneumatic Helmet Entity Tracker
* - Note that Chest & Hopper Minecart inventories are not displayed
* - Note that @minecart can be useful here as an entity filter to match all minecarts
* Significantly reduced Pneumatic Helmet Block Tracker network chatter, especially in areas with many inventories
* - Was sync'ing more inventory data from server to client than really necessary
* Pneumatic Helmet Entity Tracker mob targeting warnings are now coalesced by mob type, where feasible
* - Reduces HUD message spam when there are many hostiles about
* - Also got rid of the "Stopped spam on Entity Tracker!" message since it's not very useful to players

Fixes

* Fixed another dedicated server crash related to mods which query fuels before world is available
* - It's a workaround; mods which query fuels very early (e.g. Minecolonies & Simple Generators) just won't see PNC:R fuel buckets, but no crash!
* Fixed Pneumatic Helmet night vision occasionally failing to deactivate properly
* - Note that when a Helmet with an installed Night Vision Upgrade is equipped, other sources of night vision (e.g. potions) will not function
* Fixed client crash in Aphorism Tile GUI when typing alt-characters outside normal Minecraft format code ranges (0-9, a-f, l, m, n, o, r)
* Fixed Air Grate Module ignoring item entities
* - Also fixed a slight bounding box misalignment for grates facing west & north which caused entities very near the grate to be ignored
* Fixed machines not always properly recalculating their incoming redstone signal on world reload
* - Caused problems with machines running when they shouldn't and vice versa
* Work around a client crash when Pressure Glass is part of a Create schematicannon preview
* - Actually a Create issue which will be fixed in next Create release, but this is a bandaid fix for now
* Fixed pressure module (Pressure Gauge/Regulator/Safety Valve) GUIs flicking from large to small on open when the module has an Advanced PCB installed
* Fixed player pose not being reset when flying with Jet Boots and running out of air
* Fixed client crash when closing inventory search window from GPS Area Tool GUI

### [Pretty Pipes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pretty-pipes) ([PrettyPipes-1.9.3.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pretty-pipes/files/3224610)⟶[PrettyPipes-1.9.4.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pretty-pipes/files/3357326))

#### [Quark-r2.4-313.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark/files/3364469)
